# my-angularjs-practice

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0.

This is my first incursion in angularjs building a CRUD example with https://reqres.in/ as Backend.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
